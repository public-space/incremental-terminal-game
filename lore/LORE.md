## The World

### What Happened?

Something went wrong. The colony ship - *Cathedral Node* - suffered catastrophic failure during transit. Emergency protocols kicked in. Drop pods scattered across this dead rock. Most didn't make it.

You're managing what's left: **Outpost 0**.

The first outpost. The testbed. The canary in the coal mine.

### Where Are We?

A planetoid. Barely qualifies as a planet. Thin atmosphere (you need suits). Dim star (solar arrays struggle). Ancient impact craters (good for mining, bad for morale).

The surveys called it **Oblivion's Lattice** - because from orbit, the crater networks look like a vast, broken grid. A lattice of scars.

Nobody calls it that anymore. Too pretentious when you're recycling your own waste to stay fed.

### Who Are We?

**Colonists**: Volunteers. Contractors. Desperate people who signed up for a new life. They didn't sign up for *this*.

- **Type A**: Optimists. "We'll make it work." They fix things. They believe in the mission.
- **Type B**: Pragmatists. "Do the job. Don't think about home." They survive. They endure.
- **Type C**: Broken. "We're already dead." They work slowly. They stare at the stars. Sometimes they don't come back.

You cycle through all three types. It's been a long haul.

### What's Out There?

**The Wreckage**: Scattered pieces of *Cathedral Node*. Some are intact enough to salvage. Some are tombs. You don't send crews to those sections anymore.

**The Craters**: Deep. Old. Pre-date humanity by eons. The miners say they find things down there sometimes. Strange geometries in the rock. Symbols that hurt to look at.

You tell them to stop looking.

**The Signal**: Sometimes, late in the Sol cycle, the comms array picks up something. Not language. Not static. Something *between* them.

You haven't told the colonists. They're stressed enough.

## Structures - Flavor Text

### ☀ Solar Array
> *"Captures photons from a dying star and converts them into marginal electrical output. Efficiency: 12%. Expected lifetime: 400 Sols. Actual lifetime: [EXCEEDS ESTIMATE]. They built these to last. That's good. You'll need them."*

**Hidden Lore**: The arrays are over-engineered. Redundant systems. Triple backups. Someone at Command knew the mission would go bad. They prepared for it. That should comfort you. It doesn't.

### ⛏ Mining Rig
> *"Automated drill assembly. Extracts ferrous compounds and structural alloys from subsurface deposits. Warning: Drill harmonics may cause psychological distress. Recommend noise-canceling equipment. Ignore any non-standard vibrations."*

**Hidden Lore**: The drill sounds wrong. Not mechanically wrong - something else. The miners won't talk about it. They just request more shifts away from Sector 7. You reassign them. You don't ask why.

### 🧬 Reclamation Bay
> *"Closed-loop biological recycling system. Converts organic waste into nutritionally adequate biomass. Taste: Poor. Nutritional value: Adequate. Psychological impact: Significant. Don't think about what goes in. Focus on what comes out."*

**Hidden Lore**: The bay has been running longer than it should without maintenance. The microbe cultures are... adapting. Efficiency is *increasing*. That's not normal. You make a note to investigate. You never do. There are bigger problems.

### 🏠 Hab Module
> *"Prefabricated living quarters. Sleeps 5 (cramped). Life support rated for 7 Sols without external power. Walls: 2cm steel-polymer composite. Radiation shielding: Minimal. Privacy: None. It's better than vacuum."*

**Hidden Lore**: Colonists carve things into the walls. Names. Dates. Symbols from home. You pretend not to notice. They pretend it helps. Maybe it does.

### 🔬 Research Terminal
> *"Access node for Colonial Archives. Database status: CORRUPTED. Estimated data loss: 67%. Remaining archives contain fragmented technical documentation, garbled transmissions, and [3,847] personal logs from personnel no longer on manifest. You can upgrade from this. Ignore the logs."*

**Hidden Lore**: Sometimes, when you're researching, the terminal shows you files you didn't request. Logs from crew members who died in the crash. Messages they recorded for families back home. The terminal shouldn't have these. You keep researching anyway. Knowledge is survival.

---

## Research - Flavor Text

### Efficient Extraction
> *"Improved drill algorithms extracted from Archive Sector 12. Original researcher: Dr. [REDACTED]. Status: MIA. Notes mention 'resonance patterns in substrate.' You don't know what that means. The drills work 50% better now. That's what matters."*

### Closed-Loop Bioreactor
> *"Advanced recycling protocols. The microbes are learning. That shouldn't be possible - these are engineered bacteria, not adaptive organisms. But efficiency is up 50%. Don't question it. You need the food."*

### Fusion Ignition
> *"Prototype fusion micro-reactor. Designed for deep-space stations. Never deployed - too unstable. You're deploying it anyway. It doubles energy output. Expected failure rate: 15% within 1000 Sols. Actual failure rate: [INSUFFICIENT DATA]. Pray it holds."*

### Redundant Systems
> *"Emergency power routing from Cathedral Node's engineering database. Systems are designed to fail gracefully. Multiple backups. Efficiency gains of 20%. Someone knew you'd need this. Someone at Command saw this coming."*

## Atmosphere & Tone

**What Colony.sh Feels Like**:

- **Cold**: You're managing a dying process. The void is patient. You're not expected to survive.
- **Industrial**: Everything is functional. Ugly. Over-engineered for failure scenarios. It works. That's all that matters.
- **Ominous**: Something is wrong. Not just the crash. Something deeper. In the craters. In the signals. In the bio-recyclers. You don't have time to investigate. You have to survive.
- **Human**: Colonists carve names into walls. They share rations. They break down. They endure. Small moments of humanity in the void.

**Inspirations**:
- **Mothership TTRPG**: "You're not expected to survive."
- **Alien (1979)**: Industrial space horror. Working-class people in a broken ship. The company doesn't care.
- **The Expanse**: Frontier colonies barely holding on. Everything is scarce. Life is cheap.
- **Caves of Qud**: Evocative, weird, memorable. Humanity endures in strange ways.

## Mysteries (For Future Expansion)

**What happened to Cathedral Node?**
- Mechanical failure?
- Sabotage?
- Something worse?

**What's in Crater Network 7?**
- Pre-human ruins?
- Natural formations that hurt to perceive?
- Nothing (but the miners don't believe that anymore)?

**What's the signal?**
- Automated beacon from another wreck?
- Something alive out there?
- Something that *was* alive?

**Why are the bio-recyclers improving?**
- Adaptive microbes?
- Contamination from crater samples?
- Intentional design (but by who)?

**Who at Command knew this would fail?**
- Why over-engineer everything?
- What were they preparing for?
- Are they still out there, waiting?

## Future Narrative Hooks (v0.2+)

**Random Events with Lore**:
- "Hull breach in Sector 3 - unknown cause. Repair crew dispatched. [Two hours later] Repair crew requests immediate evacuation. Deny request. Breach sealed. Crew refuses to discuss incident."
- "Mining Rig 2 reports finding 'non-standard geological formation' at depth. Recommend quarantine. Recommendation ignored [ADMIN OVERRIDE]. Metal production +25%. Rig 2 crew transfers requested. Denied."
- "Colonist Mx. Chen reports recurring dreams of 'vast machinery beneath the surface.' Psychological evaluation scheduled. Evaluation cancelled [insufficient medical resources]. Mx. Chen returns to duty."

**Named Colonists**:
- When they die, show their role, time in service, last known location
- "Mx. Chen [Miner, 23 Sols service] - DECEASED - Sector 7 collapse - cause: [UNDER INVESTIGATION]"
- Colonists leave messages in event log before major incidents

**Archive Fragments**:
- Unlock corrupted personal logs from Research Terminal
- Piece together what happened to Cathedral Node
- Discover previous outposts failed (you're not Outpost 0, you're Outpost *try again*)

---

**The Truth**: You will survive. You will expand. You will stabilize the colony.

**The Cost**: You will stop asking questions. You will ignore the signals. You will override safety protocols. You will become what survival demands.

**The Horror**: One day, you will realize you've stopped thinking of colonists as people. They're resources now. Production units. Acceptable losses.

And the worst part? That's what keeps them alive.
