## 🎭 Characters & Colonists

### Named Colonists (Future System)

**Template**:
- Name (procedurally generated or curated list)
- Role (Miner, Engineer, Researcher, Administrator, Medic)
- Personality trait (Optimist, Pragmatist, Pessimist, Paranoid, Resilient)
- Background fragment (one line: "Former stellar cartographer" / "Joined for the signing bonus" / "Running from something")
- Death message variant based on role/personality

**Example Colonists**:
1. **Mx. Chen** - Miner, Pragmatist, "Signed up to pay off family debt"
   - Death: "Mx. Chen [23 Sols service] - DECEASED - Sector 7 collapse - They knew the risks."
2. **Dr. Kowalski** - Researcher, Optimist, "Believes in the mission"
   - Death: "Dr. Kowalski [45 Sols service] - DECEASED - Lab accident - They died advancing knowledge."
3. **Sgt. Martinez** - Engineer, Paranoid, "Saw something during the crash"
   - Death: "Sgt. Martinez [18 Sols service] - DECEASED - Hull breach repair - They were right to be afraid."
4. **Mx. Okafor** - Medic, Resilient, "Has seen worse"
   - Death: "Mx. Okafor [67 Sols service] - DECEASED - Contamination exposure - They saved three others first."
5. **Jin** - Administrator, Pessimist, "We're already dead"
   - Death: "Jin [12 Sols service] - DECEASED - Suit failure - They were right."

**Flavor Events**:
- Colonists request transfers away from specific sectors
- Colonists report strange dreams
- Colonists share rations with each other (morale boost)
- Colonists carve names into hab walls
- Colonists ask about returning home (you have no answer)

## 🌑 The Planetoid - Oblivion's Lattice

### Geography

**Crater Networks**:
- **Network 1-6**: Mapped, safe(ish), active mining
- **Network 7**: Anomalous readings, crew refuses to work there, highest metal yields
- **Network 8**: Unexplored, scanners return contradictory data
- **The Lattice Core**: Deepest crater, origin of the lattice pattern, inaccessible (yet)

**Weather/Environment**:
- Dust storms (reduce solar efficiency)
- Radiation pulses (from dying star?)
- Temperature swings (day/night cycle)
- "Quiet periods" (when signals stop - colonists say it's worse than hearing them)

### Discoveries

**Things Found in Craters**:
- Ancient impact glass (useful for something?)
- Subsurface ice deposits (water! But it tastes wrong)
- Metal with non-standard crystalline structure (stronger, but miners won't touch it)
- Symbols carved into bedrock (pre-date impacts by millions of years)
- Empty spaces (voids that shouldn't exist geologically)
- "The Humming Stones" (miners avoid them, but ore is rich nearby)

**The Wreckage**:
- Cathedral Node sections scattered across 200km
- Some sections have power (how?)
- Personal effects (photos, letters, recordings)
- Black boxes (encrypted, corrupted, fragments playable)
- The Bridge (found at Sol 100? Major milestone, reveals truth?)

## 📡 The Signal

### What It Could Be

**Option 1: Automated Beacon**
- From another failed colony ship
- Or from previous outpost attempts
- Warning message (corrupted)
- Coordinates to... something

**Option 2: Natural Phenomenon**
- Exotic matter in planet core
- Quantum resonance from crater formations
- Pulsar interference
- Nothing supernatural, just weird physics

**Option 3: Something Else**
- Not natural
- Not human
- Not hostile (yet)
- Observing
- Waiting

**Option 4: Cathedral Node AI**
- Ship AI survived the crash
- Fragmented across wreckage
- Trying to contact you
- Going mad in isolation
- Wants to help (or thinks it does)

**Option 5: You**
- Time loop
- Future outpost sending warnings back
- You're receiving your own messages
- The crash hasn't happened yet / already happened infinite times
- Breaking the loop requires [SPOILER FOR v1.0]

### Signal Mechanics (Future)

**Progressive Revelation**:
- Sol 50: First detection
- Sol 100: Pattern recognition
- Sol 150: Partial decode
- Sol 200: Source triangulation
- Sol 250: Contact established
- Sol 300: Understanding
- Sol 350: Choice

**Player Choices**:
- Investigate or ignore?
- Share with colonists or keep secret?
- Respond or stay silent?
- Follow coordinates or stay safe?

## 🏛️ Cathedral Node - The Colony Ship

### Ship Details

**Class**: Cathedral-class colony vessel
**Capacity**: 10,000 colonists (cryo)
**Crew**: 200 (active)
**Mission**: Establish Frontier Outpost in Sector [REDACTED]
**Status**: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

**Why "Cathedral"?**:
- Ships are named for what they represent: faith, hope, sanctuary
- Cathedral Node was the 7th of its class
- Previous ships: Cathedral Prime, Cathedral Spire, Cathedral Sanctum, Cathedral Requiem, Cathedral Vigil, Cathedral Last
- "Node" = connection point, network hub, intersection
- Designed to be the hub for multiple outposts (you're the first)

### What Happened?

**Official Story** (what you were told):
- Navigational error during drift-space transit
- Emergency protocols engaged
- Drop pods deployed
- Acceptable casualties

**Crew Rumors** (fragments in personal logs):
- Navigational computers showed contradictory readings hours before crash
- Engineering reported "impossible" power fluctuations
- Medical bay filled with crew reporting nightmares days before incident
- Someone activated drop pods manually, before automatic trigger
- Not all casualties were from the crash

**The Truth** (discoverable in v1.0):
- [Reserved for endgame revelation]
- [Player assembles from Archive fragments]
- [Multiple interpretations possible]
- [Cosmic horror? Corporate negligence? Time anomaly? Player decides]

## 🔬 Research Archive Lore

### Lost Researchers

**Dr. [REDACTED]** - Efficient Extraction research
- Last known location: Mining platform, Sector 7
- Last log entry: "The resonance patterns are not geological."
- Status: MIA
- Their research works. You don't ask how they discovered it.

**Chief Engineer Voss** - Redundant Systems
- Last known location: Cathedral Node engineering deck
- Last log entry: "Overengineering everything. If this goes wrong, they'll need every backup I can give them."
- Status: DECEASED (confirmed)
- They knew. They tried to help. It wasn't enough.

**Dr. Adeyemi** - Closed-Loop Bioreactor
- Last known location: Biological research lab
- Last log entry: "Adaptive strains showing unprecedented optimization. Recommend immediate quarantine. REQUEST DENIED [ADMIN OVERRIDE - MISSION CRITICAL]."
- Status: Unknown
- The microbes are still adapting. You don't think about what they're adapting *from*.

**Physicist Ramanujan** - Fusion Ignition
- Last known location: Deep space research station (pre-mission)
- Last log entry: "Reactor instability resolved via [CORRUPTED] - deployment not recommended without extensive testing."
- Status: Unknown
- You deployed it anyway. It works. So far.

### Archive Fragments (Collectible Lore)

**Fragment 001: Personal Log - Colonist #4,472**
> "Day 3 of the journey. Can't sleep in cryo. They say that's normal, first-timers feel the cold dreams. But this isn't cold. This is... I don't know how to describe it. Like falling through something vast and empty and *aware*. The med tech gave me sedatives. They don't help. I keep dreaming of a lattice. A vast broken grid. And something underneath it, looking up."

**Fragment 002: Engineering Report - Chief Voss**
> "Overengineering the solar arrays, life support, and hab modules. Mission parameters don't justify this level of redundancy, but my gut says otherwise. Command approved the changes without question. That worries me more than if they'd said no. It's like they're *expecting* something to go wrong."

**Fragment 003: Medical Log - Dr. Hassan**
> "Seventeen crew members report recurring nightmares. Same imagery: broken ships, vast craters, symbols that hurt to remember upon waking. Psychiatric evaluation shows no underlying pathology. Recommend postponing deployment. REQUEST DENIED. 'Crew will adapt once mission begins.' I don't like this."

**Fragment 004: Navigation Log - Lt. Chen**
> "Drift-space coordinates are shifting. Minor fluctuations, within acceptable variance. But the pattern is wrong. It's not random drift - it's consistent. Like something is pulling us. Off-course by 0.003%. Reporting to command."

**Fragment 005: Navigation Log - Lt. Chen (12 hours later)**
> "Course correction ineffective. We're accelerating. Drift-space shouldn't work like this. Engaging emergency protocols."

**Fragment 006: Final Transmission - Captain Okonkwo**
> "This is Captain Okonkwo, Cathedral Node. Emergency drop pod deployment authorized. All crew to stations. If you're receiving this, we didn't make it. The colonists did. Keep them alive. That's all that matters now. Tell Command [TRANSMISSION ENDS]."

## 🎲 Random Events Ideas

### Early Game (Sol 1-30)

**Resource Events**:
- "Solar flare detected - energy production +20% for 1 Sol"
- "Dust storm approaching - solar efficiency -30% for 3 Sols"
- "Lucky strike - mining crew finds rich vein - +15 metal (one-time)"
- "Recycler contamination - biomass production -25% for 2 Sols"

**Flavor Events** (no mechanical effect):
- "Colonist reports seeing 'lights' in crater network. Investigation finds lens flare from hab module. Probably."
- "Crew shares extra rations with new arrivals. Morale improves."
- "Engineer Sato jury-rigs coffee maker from spare parts. Colonists celebrate small victory."

### Mid Game (Sol 31-60)

**Crisis Events**:
- "Hull breach in Sector 3 - lose 10 energy to emergency repairs OR lose 1 colonist"
- "Equipment failure - choose: lose 1 Mining Rig permanently OR spend 30 metal to repair"
- "Medical emergency - spend 15 biomass for treatment OR lose 1 colonist"

**Discovery Events**:
- "Mining crew finds Cathedral Node black box - unlock Archive Fragment"
- "Research Terminal decodes partial transmission - gain 1 research for free"
- "Scouts locate intact supply pod - gain random resources"

**Ominous Events**:
- "Communications array receives brief transmission: [STATIC] '...not alone...' [STATIC]. Source: Unknown."
- "Miners in Sector 7 refuse to continue. You reassign them. Production continues."
- "Colonist asks 'When are we going home?' You have no answer."

### Late Game (Sol 61+)

**Escalation Events**:
- "Something is wrong with the bio-recyclers. Efficiency is *increasing*. That's not normal. Investigate? [Yes = lose 2 Sols production / No = continue as is]"
- "Fusion reactor output exceeds design specs by 20%. Emergency shutdown? [Yes = lose reactor / No = gain +50% energy but risk failure]"
- "The Signal is getting louder. Triangulation complete. Source: Lattice Core. Expedition? [Yes = major story event / No = ignore]"

**Endgame Setup**:
- "Cathedral Node Bridge section located. Recover data? [Major story reveal]"
- "Crater Network 7 geological survey complete. Findings: [REDACTED]. Access granted? [Point of no return]"
- "You've built a stable colony. Resources are sustainable. You've won. But the Signal won't stop. Do you answer?"

## 🎯 Prestige Mechanic Lore

### "Archive Protocol"

**Concept**: When colony fails (or succeeds), activate Archive Protocol

**Narrative**:
> "ARCHIVE PROTOCOL INITIATED
>
> Colonial Administrator, your service is noted.
> Colony data uploaded to Cathedral Node archive.
> Lessons learned. Mistakes catalogued. Knowledge preserved.
>
> New administrator assigned to Outpost 0.
> [That administrator is you]
> [This is not your first attempt]
> [How many times have you done this?]
>
> Previous administrator notes available.
> (These are your bonuses)
>
> Sol count reset to 0.
> The void is patient.
> So are you.
>
> BEGIN AGAIN."

**Bonuses**:
- +10% production (you've optimized workflow)
- Start with extra resources (you know what to prioritize)
- Unlock 1 research immediately (you remember what worked)
- Unlock "Memories" tab (view stats from previous runs)

**Horror Element**:
- Each reset, event log shows fragments from previous run
- "[Sol 001] ℹ Note from previous administrator: 'Avoid Sector 7'"
- "[Sol 005] ℹ Note from previous administrator: 'Don't investigate the Signal'"
- "[Sol 010] ℹ Note from previous administrator: 'I'm sorry. I couldn't save them all. Maybe you can.'"

## 🌌 Expanded Universe Ideas

### Other Outposts

**Outpost 1**: Lost contact Sol 45
**Outpost 2**: Successful! Thriving colony (or so you're told)
**Outpost 3**: Never established (ship disappeared in transit)
**Outpost 4**: Requesting emergency evacuation (request denied by Command)

Could you contact them? Trade resources? Or just... hear their final transmissions?

### The Company (Command)

**What are they?**:
- Megacorporation funding colonial expansion?
- Government agency?
- Last remnant of Earth authority?
- Something pretending to be human?

**Why don't they respond?**:
- Too far away (realistic)
- They're gone (dark)
- They're listening but can't/won't help (darker)
- They're running the experiment (darkest)

### Aliens? (Maybe)

**Not Little Green Men**:
- Vast, ancient, incomprehensible
- Not hostile - indifferent (worse)
- Left ruins across the galaxy
- Humanity is building colonies on their corpses
- Sometimes the corpses dream

**Or Maybe**:
- Just us, alone in the dark
- The horror is human (corporate greed, negligence, ambition)
- The Signal is our own ghosts
- We are the monsters

## 💬 Dialogue Concepts

### Colonist Requests

**Request for Transfer**:
> "Administrator, requesting transfer from Mining Sector 7. Personal reasons. Please."
> [Approve: lose 1 miner from Sector 7, morale improves]
> [Deny: miner stays, morale decreases]

**Request for Answers**:
> "Administrator, when are we going home?"
> [Response options:]
> - "When the mission is complete." [+morale, false hope]
> - "We are home now." [neutral, pragmatic]
> - "I don't know." [-morale, honest]
> - [Say nothing] [--morale, you've stopped pretending]

**Request for Help**:
> "Medical emergency - Colonist injured in Sector 4. Need biomass for treatment. Please."
> [Approve: spend 15 biomass, save colonist]
> [Deny: save resources, lose colonist]
> [You know what you'll choose before you see the request anymore]

### System Messages (Increasing Strangeness)

**Sol 1-50**: Professional, clinical
> "[Sol 023] ✓ Mining Rig constructed - metal production increased"

**Sol 51-100**: Minor anomalies noted
> "[Sol 067] ⚠ Mining Rig 2 reports unusual drill harmonics - investigating"

**Sol 101-150**: Anomalies dismissed
> "[Sol 112] ℹ Investigation suspended - priority: resource production"

**Sol 151-200**: You stop investigating
> "[Sol 178] ⚠ Bio-recycler efficiency exceeds projections by 35%"
> "[Sol 178] ℹ Administrator note: Acceptable deviation"

**Sol 201+**: You've normalized the impossible
> "[Sol 234] ⚠ Signal strength increasing - source confirmed: Lattice Core"
> "[Sol 234] ℹ Administrator note: Irrelevant to mission"
> "[Sol 235] ⚠ Colonists requesting guidance regarding Signal"
> "[Sol 235] ℹ Administrator note: Continue standard operations"
> "[Sol 236] ⚠ The Signal knows you're listening"
