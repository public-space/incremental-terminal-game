# colony.sh (v0.2) PLAYTEST & BUG REPORT

> [Note: Hey Claude. I've tested the game and there is a few things I have noticed. Overall there have been many improvements. Fantastic job. ]

1. The start menu looks great. 
2. there is still the flickering on the main game page. 
3. I would assume that if you increased the screen updates to 24+ a second it would reduce this effect. for human eyes. like normal fps. maybe shoot for 30fps. see how that looks? I thought 5 was pretty slow. maybe i'm wrong, i'm not sure.
4. the width of the borders is much better but still off in a few places. Only by one or two character places. 
5. the ticks and the sol days are working. 
6. still having the issue where i have to quicly enter the menu commands before they disappear. what libraries are you using to print to the terminal? i know there are some that update without going down. maybe we should look into what other libraries would allow us to have a cleaner TUI experience without a major overhaul. is worth investigation. 
7. it is only on the home screen this happens. this doesn't happen in the build/info/other menus.
8. buying the solar array worked. but i realized there's only enough metal to buy that one. and if i do i cant buy a drill to make more metal. so maybe the dialog will be of high importance so we can know the user needs to which one to buy first. like a tutorial. otherwise they're screwed. 
9. started a new save. buying the mining rig worked! it incremented up appropriately as well!
10. old save worked as well
11. research is working. Spent on Closed-loop bioreactor (fucking loved what you did with this in the lore. reminded me of soyllent green lol)
12. Fusion rsearched worked. everything incremented well
13. Efficient energy extraction worked as well
14. Tested every research and they all worked correctly
15. tested buying and upgrading everything and they all seemed to work. For some reason when going from the build menu to home screen the numbers from Energy jumped dow from 68.3 to 20-30. even though theyre find, then jump back up. 
16. need to make structures clearer and cleaner, of what is being used. the color codng will help
17. info page looks good. maybe we should put a border around it. whatever you think
18. was able to do a new save but no menu so i'm assuming the old save was erased. an auto save feature every minute would be a smart idea. could be longer. 
19. Help menu borders are a bit wonky to. Make sure to check the engine ui modules and see if those may be causeing the problem. tho i've noticed this is an issue with tui's and libraries like textual. expanding the terminal width doesn't seem to change or affect it much. 
20. the help menu doesn't flicker either. what is the difference between the home menu and the others? 
    

Overall there were many improvements and it's working wonderfully! I can really see and feel this game coming together :) let's get these fixed and then we can continue with v0.3 and improvements.
