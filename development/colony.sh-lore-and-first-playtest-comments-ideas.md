# Things I've noticed playing v0.1 Colony.sh

1. There is some flickering in the main menu
2. The borders aren't quite lined up properly
3. Other than that it looks so much better than i expected! i'm so glad we were super thoroguh with it! and what a base for an engine! i'm also glad 
4. the menus are actually amazing and very clear and more than i could've hoped
5. the coloring is really good. will need to be more reative. 
6. also in the go terminal roguelike shamogu he used somethign where you could run it with a `-t` flag for a very basic tileset
		 `~$ ./shamogu -t`
7. when i try and enter commands (because of the flickering) i have to catch the letter and enter super quickly or it goes away. 
8. i do love all the commands claude has chose and don't want to change those. 
9. i want to be very careful making changes and make sure we're both clear going forward cuz i honeslty think they did amazin gand i love it. just needs a little polishing and smoothing. 
10. but so far if it didn't flicker i could get deep into this. especially with tthe lore discovery aspect. damn i was literaly going 'what!' and 'oh fuck' 'that's so good' and laughing and surprised cuz the lore hit so goddamn hard and was so cool and immersive. 
11. i'm very impressed and very excited. 
12. the color palllete claude chose is amazing as well. 
13. got this error when i tried to build a second solar array (great choice btw)
```python
║ [Sol 004 06:49:48] ⚠ Error: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'ResourceManager' ║
║ [Sol 004 06:49:57] ⚠ Error: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'ResourceManager' ║
```

14. got the error when trying to build a drill as well
15. the timers and tickers seem to be working perfectly tho. 
16. need to make sure to balance well. some games like this go way to slow and are miserable. and some are good but go too fast
17. skynet simulator was almost perfect. in having lore and story and puzzles to drive you on. later on i could see this being a mechanic in a larger game. i m glad we did this and not medieval. i'm not a big fantasy fan
18. got this error when trying to research
```python
║ [Sol 007 06:52:42] ⚠ Error: UpgradeManager.purchase() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given ║
```
19. we need to add error handling in the form of dialouges for the user. 
20. eventually it would be amaizng to have a tmux/tiled kind of large termnal window so the user can see many things at once. 
21. it will also look amazing and give the user the feeling of having this mass complex system to learn they are in charge in. a very immersive entering a world to learn and be in feeling
22. this is what i love about a game
23. and to make players feel like hackers lol
24. it's one of my favorite things in space omvies like alien and space odyssey and others. the huge super cool immersive interface. 
25. we'll have to have a future session making sick alien esque unix terminal interfaces and animations. 
26. damn that would be sick and fit with the game so well. 
27. eventually make a gui GPL or SDL or whatever graphic version. but i always want to have a super thought out good terminal verison
28. help screen works perfectly
29. save works good. lets see if it loads when i exit
30. the info screen is awesome!
31. want to create a message log that logs everything the user does
32. this will later turn into a lore log as well :))))
33. quit worked well. 
34. now lets reload :)
35. fuck the load and save worked! 
36. great job claude :)
37. youre a beast my friend. i'm so stoked!
38. `Colony systems restored from archive is cool too`
39. and instead of gravestones in some games we'll do it kind of how dwarf fortress does but different!
40. the lore of your dead ship can be like logs you find in anothe game
41. claude brought this up in the lore anyway!
42. imagine in a multiplayer connected version other new users got ship logs from dead real players!
43. stoked
44.
