## üè∑Ô∏è Game Names

### Chosen: **colony.sh** ‚úì
**Why it's perfect**:
- `.sh` extension = instant terminal/Linux aesthetic
- Concise, memorable, easy to type
- Fits the frontier colony theme perfectly
- Professional yet playful
- Launcher command: `./colony.sh`

### Other Name Ideas
*(Add alternatives here for future consideration)*

---

## üöÄ Colony.sh - Current Implementation
**Dark sci-fi frontier colony management**
**Vibe**: Mothership, cosmic horror, fragile survival on the edge of oblivion
**Tone**: Cold, computational, ominous - you're managing a dying process trying to stay alive

### Phase 1 - Core Survival System ‚úì (In Progress)
**Resources (4)**:
- **Energy** - Life support. Without it, everything stops.
- **Metal** - Salvaged from the wreckage. Construction material.
- **Biomass** - Recycled organic matter. Keeps colonists alive.
- **Colonists** - Fragile human units. They break easily.

**Structures (5)**:
- **Solar Array** - Harvests dim starlight. Barely enough.
- **Mining Rig** - Drills into dead rock. Hungry for power.
- **Reclamation Bay** - Turns waste into something edible. Don't think about it.
- **Hab Module** - Cramped quarters. Better than vacuum.
- **Research Terminal** - Access to corrupted databases. Maybe they'll help.

**Research (3-4)**:
- **Efficient Extraction** - Squeeze more from nothing
- **Closed-Loop Bioreactor** - Less waste. More time.
- **Fusion Ignition** - Brief hope. Exponential power.

**Event Log**: Cold timestamps. Sol count. Messages from a dying outpost.

### Phase 2 - Entropy Creeps In
- **Random Events**: Signal loss, hull breach, equipment decay, **something in the dark**
- **Environmental Hazards**: Radiation storms, cold snaps, dust clouds that eat metal
- **Colonist System**: They have names. They have needs. They die.
- **Deeper Research**: Unlock fragments of pre-collapse tech
- **New Resources**: Rare elements, corrupted data, oxygen debt

### Phase 3 - The Lattice Expands
- **Multiple Nodes**: Other outposts. Some respond. Some don't.
- **Exploration**: Send crews into the unknown. Not all return.
- **Automation Tier**: AI assistants. They help. They watch.
- **Defense Protocols**: Against what? You don't know yet.
- **Wonder Projects**: Cathedral Node, Drift Engine, Void Beacon
- **Prestige**: "Archive Protocol" - reset but keep knowledge
