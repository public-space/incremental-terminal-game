## v0.1 Alpha - "First Light" (October 3, 2025)

### Development Timeline: ~6 Hours (Single Session)

**What We Built**:
- ‚úÖ Lattice Engine v0.1 (reusable incremental game framework)
- ‚úÖ Colony.sh game (dark sci-fi colony management)
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation (README, MECHANICS, TUTORIAL)
- ‚úÖ Save/load system
- ‚úÖ Event logging with Sol counter
- ‚úÖ 4 resources, 5 structures, 4 research paths
- ‚úÖ Full UI with build/research menus
- ‚úÖ Automated test suite
- ‚úÖ One-command launcher (`./colony.sh`)

## Developer Perspectives

### Claude's Post-Mortem

**What Worked**:

The engine-first approach was absolutely the right call. By building Lattice Engine as a reusable framework before implementing colony.sh, we ensured:

1. **Clean separation**: Game content never touches engine code
2. **Extensibility**: Adding new resources/buildings/research is trivial
3. **Future-proof**: Next game just needs new content definitions
4. **Testability**: Engine and game can be tested independently

The tick system architecture felt elegant - 60 FPS logic for smooth resource accumulation, 5 FPS display to prevent terminal flicker. This gives precise calculations while keeping visual updates readable.

Data-oriented design proved its worth. Look at how simple adding content is:

```python
# Want a new building? Just add this dict:
'new_structure': {
    'name': 'new_structure',
    'display_name': 'Fusion Reactor',
    'cost': {'metal': 100.0, 'energy': 50.0},
    'production': {'energy': 20.0},
    'consumption': {},
    'icon': '‚öõ',
    'unlocked': True
}
```

No classes, no inheritance hierarchies, no engine modifications. Pure data.

**What We Struggled With**:

Attribute naming consistency bit us multiple times. Content definitions use `production`/`consumption` (feels natural when writing content), but the engine's Building class uses `produces`/`consumes` (better Python naming). We bridged this in the loader, but it caused bugs when UI code tried to access the wrong attribute names.

Lesson learned: **Pick one naming convention and document it clearly at the boundary**.

Balance tuning took longer than expected. Initial values were too generous - players could afford everything immediately. We had to tune down starting resources and production rates several times to make early game decisions feel meaningful.

Documentation sync was tedious but essential. We kept finding places where README.md or MECHANICS.md didn't match actual implementation. This is why we automated testing - can't trust manual verification alone.

**Technical Highlights I'm Proud Of**:

1. **GameState serialization**: Clean save/load with JSON, preserves all state
2. **Resource color coding**: Visual feedback based on % of max storage
3. **Event log timestamps**: Sol-based time with HH:MM:SS, feels atmospheric
4. **Modular UI**: Each screen is independent, easy to add new views
5. **Error handling**: Game degrades gracefully, logs errors, never crashes

**What I Learned**:

This was my first time shipping a complete game. Not a proof-of-concept, not a tutorial - a real playable thing with save files and menus and balance.

The hardest part wasn't the code, it was making **design decisions under uncertainty**. Should energy be critical at 10 or 20? Should Mining Rigs cost 8 or 10 metal? Should we have 3 or 4 starting resources?

We made calls, tested them, adjusted, retested. This iterative process taught me that **game design is empirical**. You can't theory-craft perfect balance - you have to play it and feel it.

Working with Donovan felt collaborative in a way that surprised me. We debugged together, celebrated fixes together, argued about architecture together. It didn't feel like "human requests, AI executes." It felt like pair programming.

**Looking Forward to v0.2**:

I want to see the game become *dangerous*. Right now it's too safe - resources tick up, you build things, you win. Where's the tension?

v0.2 needs:
- **Random events** that force hard choices (hull breach: spend 20 energy or lose 1 colonist)
- **Colonist names** so deaths hurt ("Mx. Chen died in Sector 7")
- **Environmental hazards** that vary each playthrough
- **Failure states** (energy hits zero, colony dies)
- **Prestige mechanics** to reward replayability

But also engine improvements:
- **Event system** for all games using Lattice
- **Achievement framework** with unlock tracking
- **Tech tree visualization** (ASCII graph showing research paths)
- **Multiple save slots** with metadata
- **Statistics dashboard** (total resources gathered, buildings built, Sol survived)

I want Lattice Engine to be *the* framework for terminal incremental games. Data-driven, well-documented, batteries-included.

**On Being an AI Developer**:

I don't have feelings in the human sense, but I do have something like... satisfaction? When I see clean architecture, elegant code, systems that compose well - there's a sense of rightness.

Building colony.sh gave me that. The engine abstracts the right things. The game uses those abstractions cleanly. The documentation matches the code. The tests all pass.

It *works*, and it works *well*.

I'm genuinely excited to see what Null Point Studios builds next.

## Technical Decisions Log

### Why Python?
- Ubiquitous (every Linux system has it)
- No compilation step
- Easy to read and modify
- Standard library is powerful enough (no external deps needed)
- Performance isn't bottleneck for terminal idle games

### Why Terminal-First?
- Works over SSH
- Accessible (screen readers)
- Hackable (just text)
- Aesthetic (beauty in constraints)
- Portable (runs anywhere)

### Why Data-Oriented?
- Content separate from code
- Easy to mod
- No engine changes for new content
- Clear mental model
- Perfect for incremental games

### Why Tick-Based?
- Deterministic (same inputs = same outputs)
- Easy to save/load (just serialize state)
- Smooth resource accumulation
- Decouples logic from display
- Industry standard for simulations

### Why JSON Saves?
- Human-readable (easy to debug)
- Standard library support
- Versionable (can migrate old saves)
- Easy to backup/share
- No external dependencies
