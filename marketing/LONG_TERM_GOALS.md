3. **Celebrate contributions**: Showcase community work
4. **Maintain transparency**: Open about human/AI collaboration
5. **Stay humble**: We're learning too, not just teaching

**Be Generous**:
- Free and open (or very affordable)
- Credit contributors

---

## üí∞ Sustainability Models (TBD)

### Option 1: Fully Free (Passion Project)
**Pros**: Maximum reach, no pressure, pure creative freedom
**Cons**: No income, relies on spare time, may limit scope

### Option 2: Donation-Based
**Pros**: Optional support, maintains free access, community values work
**Cons**: Unpredictable income, requires significant audience

### Option 3: Pay-What-You-Want
**Pros**: Generates some income, feels fair, itch.io supports this
**Cons**: Still unpredictable, some may expect more if they pay

### Option 4: Free Core + Paid Expansions
**Pros**: Base game free (good for growth), premium content funds development
**Cons**: Risk of splitting community, requires significant content pipeline

### Option 5: Steam Release (Long-Term)
**Pros**: Wider audience, potential revenue, visibility
**Cons**: Terminal games on Steam? Requires packaging solution, expectations differ

**Current Plan**: Start fully free, add donations if community wants to support, reassess at v1.0

## üéÆ Game Pipeline

### Priority 1: Colony.sh
**Status**: v0.1 alpha complete
**Target**: v1.0 by October 2026
**Focus**: Deep, polished, memorable experience

### Priority 2: Second Lattice Engine Game
**Candidates**:
1. **Medieval Kingdom Sim** (most different from colony.sh, broad appeal)
2. **AI Research Lab** (good for showcasing exponential mechanics)
3. **Post-Apocalyptic Survivor** (fits terminal aesthetic well)

**Purpose**: Prove Lattice Engine is truly reusable and flexible
**Target**: Alpha by March 2026

### Priority 3: Community Showcase
**Once modding tools ready**: Highlight best community creations
**Target**: Ongoing from Phase 2 onward

### Priority 4: Experimental Projects
- Physical/digital hybrid game (Mothership trifold jam?)
- Cross-engine experiments (connect to Kalachakra?)
- Genre-bending (incremental + roguelike? incremental + narrative?)

## ‚ùì Open Questions (To Decide)

1. **Open Source Timing**: Launch public now, or wait until v1.0?
2. **Monetization**: Free forever, or donations, or paid content?
3. **Community Platform**: Discord? Matrix? Forums? Just GitHub?
4. **Scope**: Focus on colony.sh v1.0, or build multiple games in parallel?
5. **Branding**: How much do we emphasize AI collaboration vs. just focusing on games?
6. **Steam**: Worth pursuing, or stay terminal-native only?
7. **Mothership Jam**: Join with colony.sh adaptation, or new project?
8. **Kalachakra Integration**: Wait and see, or plan connection points now?
