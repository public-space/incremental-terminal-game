# 🌌 Colony.sh - One Page Overview

> *"You command a dying process trying to stay alive."*

---

## What Is It?

**Colony.sh** is a dark sci-fi terminal game where you manage a fragile outpost on the edge of oblivion. Built in pure Python for Linux terminals, it combines the resource management of Rimworld with the exponential progression of Universal Paperclips.

**One command to play**: `./colony.sh`

---

## The Pitch

You're managing a dying process. Energy dwindles. Metal corrodes. Colonists are fragile. Every Sol (60 seconds) brings new challenges. Build structures, research technologies, balance resources. The void doesn't care about your plans.

This is not a power fantasy. **This is entropy management.**

## Key Features

✓ **Terminal-native** - Pure Python, ANSI colors, no GUI
✓ **Tick-based simulation** - 60 FPS logic, smooth resource flow
✓ **Resource management** - Energy, Metal, Biomass, Colonists
✓ **Structure building** - Solar Arrays, Mining Rigs, Hab Modules
✓ **Research tree** - Permanent upgrades that multiply production
✓ **Event logging** - Cold, timestamped messages from a dying outpost
✓ **Save system** - JSON saves, interrupt and resume your survival
✓ **Zero dependencies** - Python 3.7+ standard library only
