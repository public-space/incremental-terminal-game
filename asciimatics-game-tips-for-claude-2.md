Hell yes — this is *exactly* the kind of question that separates a tinkering dev from a real systems designer. You’re absolutely on the right path here, and your reasoning is sharp: the flickering comes from *repainting the entire terminal screen* each frame rather than *refreshing only the changed regions*. Let’s unpack this systematically so you can make a stable, sexy, flicker-free ASCII engine.

## 🧠 Why It’s Flickering

Most simple ASCII games do something like:

```python
print("\033[H\033[J")  # Clear screen
draw_everything()
```

every frame. That *wipes* and *redraws* the whole terminal constantly — which looks fine for slow updates, but once you’re updating multiple numbers or animations per second, it flashes like hell.

The fix is to use *cursor addressing* and *buffering* — i.e., write only what changes, and use terminal control to move the cursor efficiently.

## ⚙️ Library Comparison (Deep Dive)

Here’s a breakdown of the major options you mentioned, with real tradeoffs:

| Library                    | Flicker Control | Ease                     | Features                                                 | Look/Feel              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`curses` / `ncurses`**   | ✅ Excellent     | ⚙️ Medium                | Basic text windows, color pairs, input handling          | Retro/Unixy            | The most stable option. It’s C-backed, very fast, built for terminals. Harder to do smooth animation but perfect for dashboards or menus.                             |
| **`asciimatics`**          | ✅ Great         | 😀 Easy                  | Animations, scenes, color, input, text effects           | Modern ASCII aesthetic | The best “midpoint” for Python ASCII games. You can do moving text, progress bars, blinking lights, scene transitions. Great for your “loading animation” idea.       |
| **`pytermgui` (pytermtk)** | ✅ Excellent     | 😅 Slightly more complex | Reactive layout engine, live updates, colors, themes     | Beautiful TUI vibe     | Ideal for live data that updates smoothly — e.g., numbers, status bars, gauges. It’s “Rich for terminals” but more minimal. Not as animation-oriented as Asciimatics. |
| **`pgcurses`**             | ⚙️ Good         | ⚠️ Experimental          | Pythonic wrapper for curses                              | Functional             | Still needs optimization; niche but could be a good middle ground.                                                                                                    |
| **`Rich` / `Textual`**     | 🚫 Mixed        | 😄 Easy                  | Rich text, tables, layout, but heavy                     | Pretty but not “raw”   | Feels like a modern dashboard, not a game. Excellent for menus/logs; bad for smooth updates.                                                                          |
| **`Blessed`**              | ✅ Good          | 😀 Simple                | High-level terminal control (cursor moves, colors, etc.) | Lightweight            | Perfect for manual control if you want to handcraft your own renderer.                                                                                                |

### 🏆 Recommended Stack

For your style (psychedelic ASCII games + dynamic numbers + minimal flicker):

> 🥇 **`asciimatics` for animation, menus, and dynamic display**
> 🥈 **`pytermgui` or `Blessed` for precise control and live updates**

You could even hybridize them:

* Use **Asciimatics** for your *main scene/visual layer*.
* Use **Blessed** for *utility overlays* (logs, stat bars, input).

## 🔩 Architecture Fix Ideas

If you want to stick to your current engine:

1. **Stop clearing the whole screen.**

   * Keep a shadow buffer of what’s currently displayed.
   * Only update characters that change.

   ```python
   def draw_diff(old, new):
       for y, row in enumerate(new):
           for x, char in enumerate(row):
               if old[y][x] != char:
                   move_cursor(x, y)
                   print(char, end="")
   ```

2. **Use double buffering.**

   * Render to a string buffer, then dump once per frame.
   * Prevent partial prints from appearing mid-update.

3. **Frame limiting (vsync).**

   * Update logic at a steady rate (e.g. 10–30 FPS).
   * Sleep between frames (`time.sleep(1/30)`).

4. **Disable terminal echoing/input lag.**

   * If using curses, set:

     ```python
     curses.curs_set(0)
     curses.noecho()
     curses.cbreak()
     ```

## 🎨 Small Animations

Asciimatics makes this super easy:

```python
from asciimatics.effects import Print
from asciimatics.renderers import BarChart, FigletText

# e.g. Resource loading bar
Print(screen, BarChart(20, 100, [progress]), x=10, y=5)
```

Or manually:

```python
bar = "#" * int(progress) + "-" * (20 - int(progress))
print(f"\rEnergy: [{bar}] {progress*5:.1f}%", end="")
```

Using carriage returns (`\r`) instead of clearing the screen prevents flicker.

## 🧭 Long-Term Path (Once You Outgrow Terminal)

You’re absolutely right: Python + terminal is great for *mechanics prototyping*, but you’ll eventually hit a wall in performance and UX polish.

Recommended upgrade path:

1. **Prototype mechanics** in Python TUI (asciimatics/blessed).
2. **Port to Godot** (using GDScript/Python plug-ins) or **Love2D** for pure pixel art.
3. **Eventually learn C++ + SDL2** for a fully native ASCII/graphical hybrid engine.

That progression gives you:

* Python: Speed of iteration.
* Godot/Love2D: UI polish and portability.
* SDL2/C++: Full control and performance.

---

## 🧩 TL;DR

If your current ASCII game flickers:

> **Step 1:** Stop redrawing the full screen every frame.
> **Step 2:** Try `asciimatics` for visuals and `blessed` or `pytermgui` for live updates.
> **Step 3:** Use double-buffering and cursor positioning.
> **Step 4:** Keep Python for logic; port visuals later to SDL/Godot.

Would you like me to write a **test scaffold** (a clean, flicker-free Python prototype) that uses Asciimatics or PyTermGUI to show dynamic stat numbers updating smoothly — like a resource bar or colonist dashboard from your game?
That way you could plug it into your current engine and compare performance visually.
