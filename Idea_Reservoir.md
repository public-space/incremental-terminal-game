## 🎮 Future Game Themes

### 🤖 AI Research Lab (Inspired by Skynet Simulator)
**Theme**: Start with basic compute resources and scale up to build AGI
- **Resources**: Compute power, data, researchers, memory, energy
- **Progression**:
  - Basic algorithms → Machine learning → Deep learning → AGI
  - Research projects that unlock new capabilities
  - Data centers, GPU farms, quantum computers
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Research trees with branching paths
  - Training cycles that take time
  - Breakthrough events
  - Ethical dilemmas and choices
  - Exponential scaling (very idle-game friendly)
- **Inspiration**: Skynet Simulator, Universal Paperclips

### 🚀 Space Mining Colony
**Theme**: Extract resources on an alien planet and expand into the stars
- **Resources**: Ore, energy, water, rare minerals, colonists
- **Progression**:
  - Mining outpost → Colony → Planetary empire → Interstellar civilization
  - Terraform planets, build space stations
  - Research alien technology
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Multiple planets/asteroids to colonize
  - Space travel and logistics
  - Alien encounters
  - Resource scarcity and trade routes

### ☢️ Post-Apocalyptic Survivor
**Theme**: Rebuild civilization from the ashes
- **Resources**: Scrap, food, water, survivors, medicine
- **Progression**:
  - Scavenger camp → Settlement → Town → New civilization
  - Clear radiation zones, restore infrastructure
  - Recruit specialists with different skills
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Random events (raiders, storms, discoveries)
  - Morale system
  - Permadeath for units (hardcore mode)
  - Exploration and map unlocking

### 🧪 Mad Scientist Laboratory
**Theme**: Conduct increasingly absurd experiments
- **Resources**: Research points, test subjects, funding, equipment
- **Progression**: Simple chemistry → Genetic engineering → Reality manipulation
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Experiment success/failure with consequences
  - Prestige through publishing papers
  - Humor and absurdist flavor text

## 🏰 Medieval Kingdom - Current Implementation Ideas

### Phase 1 Expansions
- **Random events**: Bandits, festivals, royal visitors, dragon attacks
- **Seasons**: Different resource generation rates in spring/summer/fall/winter
- **Heroes/Champions**: Special units with names and leveling
- **Quests**: Short objectives with rewards

### Phase 2 Expansions
- **Military system**: Train armies, conquer territories
- **Diplomacy**: Trade with neighboring kingdoms
- **Technology tree**: Unlock new building types and upgrades
- **Prestige system**: Reset with bonuses

### Phase 3 Expansions
- **Multiple provinces**: Manage different regions
- **Religion/Culture**: Temples, monasteries, cultural bonuses
- **Wonder buildings**: Mega-projects with massive benefits
- **Multiplayer leaderboards**: Compare progress with other players

## 🎨 Visual Improvements
- Animated ASCII art (walking workers, building construction)
- Color themes (dark mode, light mode, cyberpunk, retro)
- Particle effects (sparkles, explosions using characters)
- Weather animations (rain, snow in background)
- Smooth transitions between screens

---

## 📝 Notes
- Keep engine modular so any theme can be swapped in
- Use data-driven design (JSON/YAML configs for game content)
- Focus on extensibility and clean APIs
- Document everything for future reference
