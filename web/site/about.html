                <p>
                    We are a <strong>human/AI collaborative game development studio</strong>.
                    Not hiding it. Not pretending. Transparent about our process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We build terminal incremental games using <strong>Lattice Engine</strong>,
                    our data-oriented framework. Quality and craft matter more than speed and quantity.

                <h2>▸ WHY TERMINAL GAMES?</h2>
                <p>
                    Terminal games are <strong>accessible</strong> - they work over SSH, on servers,
                    on old hardware, and with screen readers. No GPU required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They're <strong>portable</strong> - pure Python, no compilation, works on Linux,
                    macOS, and WSL. No dependencies beyond the standard library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They're <strong>hackable</strong> - just text files. Easy to read, modify, fork.
                    Version control friendly. Educational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And they're <strong>beautiful</strong> - there's elegance in constraints.
                    Retro computing nostalgia. ANSI art. Minimalist, functional design.
                </p>

                <h2>▸ WHY HUMAN/AI COLLABORATION?</h2>
                <p>
                    Because it works. Donovan provides vision, design sense, and understanding of what
                    makes games fun. Claude provides implementation speed, architectural knowledge,
                    and documentation thoroughness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, we shipped colony.sh v0.1 alpha in <strong>6 hours</strong> -
                    from concept to playable game with complete documentation. That's not just fast
                    execution; it's true collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're transparent about this process because <strong>hiding it would be dishonest</strong>.
                    People are divided about AI-assisted development, often due to fear. We believe in showing
                    that when done thoughtfully, human + AI collaboration can produce real craft.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>▸ WHAT'S NEXT?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Short term:</strong> Ship colony.sh v0.2 with random events, achievements,
                    and named colonists. Make the game dangerous and memorable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Mid term:</strong> Build second game on Lattice Engine (medieval kingdom?
                    AI research lab?). Prove the framework is truly reusable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Long term:</strong> Establish Lattice Engine as <em>the</em> framework for
                    terminal incremental games. Foster a community of creators. Experiment with
                    cross-media (digital + physical) games.
